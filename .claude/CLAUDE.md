# DED Website - Claude Code Notes

## Git Repository & Test Site

**Repository:** https://github.com/lawlap/DED_testSite
**Live Test Site:** https://lawlap.github.io/DED_testSite/

## Publishing Updates

After making changes to the website files, push updates to GitHub Pages:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Description of changes" && git push
```

GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds the site within 1-2 minutes of each push.

## Workflow Reminder

Periodically push updates to keep the test site current for department review. The test site mirrors the local working copy and serves as a preview before publishing to the live NMSU server at `business.nmsu.edu/ded/`.
